## Methodology Map

The methodology map is a guide to determine the appropriate analytical technique(s) to solve a particular business question or problem.

The map outlines two main scenarios for a business problem:

Data analysis
Predictive analysis
Data analysis refers to the more standard approaches of blending together data and reporting on trends and statistics and helps answer business questions that involve understanding more about the dataset such as "On average, how many people order coffee and a donut per transaction in my store in any given week?"

Predictive analysis will help businesses predict future behavior based on existing data such as "Given the average coffee order, how much coffee can I expect to sell next week if I were to add a new brand of coffee?"

It's highly suggested you download and print this map to help you figure out what kind of analytical techniques you should use given any business problem you may work on in your career.
