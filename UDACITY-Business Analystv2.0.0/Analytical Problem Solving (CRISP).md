## CRISP-DM
This framework was originally developed by data miners in order to generalize the common approaches to defining and analyzing a problem. In this course, we will call CRISP-DM the "Problem Solving Framework".

The framework is made up of 6 steps:

* Business Issue Understanding
* Data Understanding
* Data Preparation
* Analysis/Modeling
