# Cursos-Business-Analyis

## CRISP-DM
This framework was originally developed by data miners in order to generalize the common approaches to defining and analyzing a problem. In this course, we will call CRISP-DM the "Problem Solving Framework".

The framework is made up of 6 steps:

* Business Issue Understanding
* Data Understanding
* Data Preparation
* Analysis/Modeling
* Validation
* Presentation/Visualization

## Business Issue Understanding
"This initial phase focuses on understanding the project objectives and requirements from a business perspective, and then converting this knowledge into a data mining problem definition, and a preliminary plan designed to achieve the objectives. A decision model, especially one built using the Decision Model and Notation standard can be used." - Wikipedia

What decisions needs to be made?
What information is needed to inform those decisions?
What type of analysis can provide the information needed to inform those decisions?

## Data Understanding
"The data understanding phase starts with an initial data collection and proceeds with activities in order to get familiar with the data, to identify data quality problems, to discover first insights into the data, or to detect interesting subsets to form hypotheses for hidden information." - Wikipedia

What data is needed?
What data is available?
What are the important characteristics of the data?

## Data Preparation

"The data preparation phase covers all activities to construct the final dataset (data that will be fed into the modeling tool(s)) from the initial raw data. Data preparation tasks are likely to be performed multiple times, and not in any prescribed order. Tasks include table, record, and attribute selection as well as transformation and cleaning of data for modeling tools." - Wikipedia

Common Steps Used in Data Preparation

Gathering: When gathering data - you may need to collect data from multiple sources within your organization.

Cleansing: The data set you are working with may have issues that you want to resolve prior to your analysis. This can be in the form of incorrect or missing data.

Formatting: You may need to format the data by changing the way a date field appears, renaming a field, or even rotating the data, similar to using a pivot table.

Blending: You may want to blend, or combine, your data with other datasets to enrich it with additional variables, similar to using the vlookup function in Excel.

Sampling: Lastly, you may want to sample the dataset and work with a more manageable number of records.

## Data Modeling

### Analysis/Modeling
"In this phase, various modeling techniques are selected and applied, and their parameters are calibrated to optimal values. Typically, there are several techniques for the same data mining problem type. Some techniques have specific requirements on the form of data. Therefore, stepping back to the data preparation phase is often needed." - Wikipedia

Important Steps
Determine what methodology to use to solve the problem

Determine the important factors or variables that will help solve the problem

Build a model to solve the problem

Run the model and move to the validation phase
