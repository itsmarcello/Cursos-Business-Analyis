# Cursos-Business-Analyis

## CRISP-DM
This framework was originally developed by data miners in order to generalize the common approaches to defining and analyzing a problem. In this course, we will call CRISP-DM the "Problem Solving Framework".

The framework is made up of 6 steps:

* Business Issue Understanding
* Data Understanding
* Data Preparation
* Analysis/Modeling
* Validation
* Presentation/Visualization

## Business Issue Understanding
"This initial phase focuses on understanding the project objectives and requirements from a business perspective, and then converting this knowledge into a data mining problem definition, and a preliminary plan designed to achieve the objectives. A decision model, especially one built using the Decision Model and Notation standard can be used." - Wikipedia

What decisions needs to be made?
What information is needed to inform those decisions?
What type of analysis can provide the information needed to inform those decisions?

## Data Understanding
"The data understanding phase starts with an initial data collection and proceeds with activities in order to get familiar with the data, to identify data quality problems, to discover first insights into the data, or to detect interesting subsets to form hypotheses for hidden information." - Wikipedia

What data is needed?
What data is available?
What are the important characteristics of the data?
